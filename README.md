# misc presentations

This is just a place to dump presentations I've given or will be giving at
various locations.

This assumes it's running in a python virtualenv.

## over-simplified setup

- make a virtualenv.  beyond scope of this doc, but probably just
  `mkvirtualenv presentations`
- clone this repo into your virtualenv, also beyond scope of this doc but
  probably just `https://github.com/nod/presentations.git`
- `pip install -r requirements.pip`
- cd to the directory of the presentation you want and type `make` to build the
  presentation and open it in chrome
